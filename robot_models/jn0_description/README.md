===============

The full Johnny-0 URDF model, originally created by Arnaud Aumont.

Johnny-0 is the torso part of the IRL-1 robot.
It can run independently from the mobile base, hence why it has its own package.

History
-------

The package was imported from the original private SVN as a rosbuild and then
converted to a catkin package.
