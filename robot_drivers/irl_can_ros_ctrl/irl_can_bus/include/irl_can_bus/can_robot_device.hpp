    /// \brief An abstract class representing a single CAN device on a bus.
    ///
    /// The normal state progress of a CAN device is this:
    ///
    ///  - DISABLED:   In this state until enable() is called.
    ///  - STARTING:   Transition state between DISABLED and ENABLED for drivers
    ///                that require async feedback from the device itself.
    ///  - ENABLED:    The device is enabled and its state is expected to be
    ///                updated.
    ///  - CONTROL:    Control is enabled on the device.
    ///
    /// Methods to implement:
    ///
    ///  - throttled()    Return the number of messages that can be sent to this
    ///                   device per reference period.
    ///                   Only called when added to the CANRobot instance.
    ///  - state()        Return the current state of the device.
    ///                   The default implementation directly returns what has
    ///                   been set by the state(const State&) method.
    ///  - requestState() Called at the beginning of the control loop.
    ///                   Messages that requests CAN variables should be sent
    ///                   at this moment.
    ///  - stateReady()   Indicates to the manager if a full state for this
    ///                   device has been received.
    ///  - sendCommand()  Called at the end of the control loop.
    ///                   Messages setting new control values should be sent at
    ///                   this moment.
    ///  - enable()       Called to enable the device, state goes from DISABLED
    ///                   to ENABLED.
    ///                   A state is not requested until the device is enabled.
    ///  - enableCtrl()   Called to enable control of the device, state goes
    ///                   from ENABLED to CONTROL.
    ///                   Commands are not requested (sendCommand()) until the
    ///                   the device is enabled for control.
    ///                   State requests are still available.
    ///  - disableCtrl()  Called to disable control the device, state goes from
    ///                   CONTROL to ENABLED.
    ///                   Request for state should still be possible.
    ///  - disable()      Disable the device completely, state goes from ENABLED
    ///                   or CONTROL to DISABLED.
    ///  - processMsg()   Process a single message coming from the CAN bus.
