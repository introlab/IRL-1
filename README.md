The main repository for the IRL-1 robot at Université de Sherbrooke's IntRoLab.

History
-------

This public repository is being built from updated packages originally found in
the original (private) IntRoLab SVN repository.
Efforts have been made to conserve as much as commit history as possible.

For any info, please contact François Ferland (francois.ferland@usherbrooke.ca).
